## Title Page

**Project Name:** Conditional Statements in Python <br/>
**Purpose:** Study of Decision Making Using Conditional Statements <br/>
**Language:** Python <br/>

---

## 🎯 Aim of the Study

The aim of this project is to study conditional statements in Python and understand how decision-making is performed in programs. <br/>
Conditional statements help control the flow of execution based on conditions.

---

## 📌 Introduction

Conditional statements in Python are used to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a condition is true or false. They play a crucial role in decision-making and logic building in programs.

---

## 📖 Study of Conditional Statements (Instructions)

* Understand what conditional statements are <br/>
* Learn how conditions are evaluated <br/>
* Use relational and logical operators <br/>
* Practice different conditional statements <br/>
* Observe program output for different conditions <br/>
* Practice programs regularly for better understanding <br/>

---

## ✅ Advantages of Conditional Statements

* Helps in decision making <br/>
* Controls program flow efficiently <br/>
* Makes programs more logical and flexible <br/>
* Reduces unnecessary code execution <br/>
* Improves problem-solving skills <br/>

---

## ❌ Disadvantages of Conditional Statements

* Can make code complex if overused <br/>
* Nested conditions reduce readability <br/>
* Logical errors may occur if conditions are incorrect <br/>
* Debugging becomes difficult in complex conditions <br/>

---

## 🔑 Key Concepts

* if statement<br/>
* if-else statement<br/>
* if-elif-else ladder<br/>
* Nested if statements<br/>
* Relational operators<br/>
* Logical operators<br/>

## 📘 Theory (Conditional Statements)

### 1. if Statement

Executes a block of code if the condition is true.
Example:

```python
if x > 0:
    print("Positive number")
```

### 2. if-else Statement

Executes one block if condition is true, otherwise another block.
Example:

```python
if x % 2 == 0:
    print("Even number")
else:
    print("Odd number")
```

### 3. if-elif-else Ladder

Used to check multiple conditions.
Example:

```python
if marks >= 90:
    grade = "A"
elif marks >= 75:
    grade = "B"
else:
    grade = "C"
```

### 4. Nested if Statement

An if statement inside another if statement.
Example:

```python
if x > 0:
    if x % 2 == 0:
        print("Positive Even")
```

### 5. Logical Operators

* and – True if both conditions are true
* or – True if any condition is true
* not – Reverses the condition

## 🛠 Tools Used

* Python Interpreter<br/>
* IDLE<br/>
* VS Code<br/>
* PyCharm<br/>
* Command Prompt / Terminal<br/>

---

## 📂 Applications of Conditional Statements

* Decision-making systems<br/>
* Grading systems<br/>
* Banking applications<br/>
* Login authentication<br/>
* Game logic<br/>
* Data Validation<br/>

---

## 🎯 Conclusion

Conditional statements are a fundamental part of Python programming. They allow programs to make decisions and execute code selectively. Mastering conditional statements is essential for writing logical, efficient, and real-world Python applications.

---

## 📎 Extra Notes

* Conditions return boolean values (True/False)<br/>
* Indentation is mandatory in Python<br/>
* Logical operators improve condition handling<br/>
* Avoid deep nesting for better readability<br/>
