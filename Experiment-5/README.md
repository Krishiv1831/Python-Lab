## 🎯 Aim of the Study

The aim of this project is to study the set and dictionary data types in Python and understand the various operations that can be performed on them. This helps in managing unordered data and key-value pair data efficiently.

---

## 📌 Introduction

Python provides built-in data types such as sets and dictionaries for storing collections of data.
A set stores unique and unordered elements, while a dictionary stores data in the form of key-value pairs. These data types are widely used for fast data access and logical operations.

## 📖 Study of Sets and Dictionaries (Instructions)

This project focuses on the following concepts:
	•	Understand what sets and dictionaries are
	•	Learn how to create sets and dictionaries
	•	Perform basic operations on sets and dictionaries
	•	Use built-in methods and functions
	•	Observe uniqueness and key-value mapping
	• Practice set and dictionary programs regularly

## ✅ Advantages
### Advantages of Sets

•	Stores only unique elements <br/>
	•	Faster membership testing <br/>
	•	Supports mathematical operations <br/>
	•	Unordered collection <br/>
	•	Efficient data handling <br/>

### Advantages of Dictionaries

•	Fast data access using keys <br/>
	•	Stores data in key-value pairs <br/>
	•	Highly flexible and efficient <br/>
	•	Easy data organization <br/>
	• Widely used in real-world applications <br/>

 ---
 
## ❌ Disadvantages
### Disadvantages of Sets

•	Unordered data <br/>
	•	Cannot access elements using index <br/>
	•	Mutable but elements must be immutable <br/> 
	•	Not suitable for duplicate data <br/>

### Disadvantages of Dictionaries

•	Keys must be unique <br/>
	•	Slightly complex syntax for beginners <br/>
	•	Cannot use mutable objects as keys <br/>

## 🧮 Algorithm

### Algorithm for Set Operations

1.) Start

2.) Create a set with some elements

3.) Display the set

4.) Add a new element to the set

5.) Remove an element from the set

6.) Perform set operations:

7.) Union

8.) Intersection

9.) Difference

10.) Display the results of each operation

11.) Stop

### Algorithm for Dictionary Operations

1.) Start

2.) Create a dictionary with key-value pairs

3.) Display the dictionary

4.) Access a value using its key

5.) Add a new key-value pair

6.) Update an existing value

7.) Remove a key-value pair

8.) Display the updated dictionary

9.) Stop

## 🔑 Key Concepts

Creating sets and dictionaries

Adding and removing elements

Set operations (union, intersection, difference)

Dictionary methods

Accessing elements using keys

---

## 📘 Theory (Operations on Sets and Dictionaries)

### 1. Creating a Set

A set is created using curly braces {}.
Example:
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4}

### 2. Creating a Dictionary

A dictionary is created using {key: value} pairs.
Example:
my_dict = {"name": "Krishiv", "age": 18}

### 3. Accessing Elements

Set elements are accessed using loops

Dictionary values are accessed using keys

Example:
my_dict["name"]

### 4. Set Operations

union() – combines elements

intersection() – common elements

difference() – uncommon elements

add() – adds an element

remove() – removes an element

### 5. Dictionary Operations

keys() – returns keys

values() – returns values

items() – returns key-value pairs

update() – updates dictionary

pop() – removes an item

### 6. Set and Dictionary Immutability

Sets are mutable but elements must be immutable

Dictionary keys must be immutable

## 📂 Applications of Sets and Dictionaries

### Applications of Sets

* Removing duplicate data
* Mathematical operations
* Membership testing
* Data comparison

### Applications of Dictionaries

*Storing student records
*Database representation
*JSON data handling
*Configuration settings
*Real-time data mapping

---

## 🎯 Conclusion

Sets and dictionaries are powerful data structures in Python. Sets are useful for handling unique data and performing logical operations, while dictionaries efficiently manage data using key-value pairs. Understanding these concepts is essential for effective Python programming.

## 📎 Extra Notes

*Sets do not allow duplicate values
*Sets do not support indexing
*Dictionary keys must be unique
*Dictionaries are widely used in APIs
*Both improve program efficiency
