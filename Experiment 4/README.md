**Purpose:** Study of Tuple and Its Operations
**Language:** Python
**Level:** Beginner

---

## 🎯 Aim of the Study

The main aim of this project is to understand the tuple data type in Python and learn how different operations are performed on it. This study helps in learning how to store fixed and ordered data safely and efficiently.

---

## 📌 Introduction

A tuple is a built-in data structure in Python that is used to store multiple values together. Tuples are ordered and immutable, meaning once a tuple is created, its values cannot be changed. Because of this property, tuples are commonly used when data should remain constant.

---

## 📖 Study of Operations on Tuple (Instructions)

This project focuses on the following concepts:
	•	Understanding what a tuple is
	•	Creating tuples in Python
	•	Accessing tuple elements
	•	Performing basic tuple operations
	•	Using built-in tuple functions
	•	Observing immutability of tuples
	•	Practicing tuple-based programs

---

## ✅ Advantages of Tuple

•	Faster execution compared to lists <br/>
	•	Uses less memory <br/>
	•	Data remains secure as it cannot be modified <br/>
	•	Can store multiple data types <br/>
	•	Useful for fixed or constant data <br/>

---

## ❌ Disadvantages of Tuple

•	Values cannot be changed once assigned <br/>
	•	Less flexible than lists <br/>
	•	No direct methods to add or delete elements <br/>
	•	Updating data is difficult <br/>

## 🔑 Key Concepts

1. Creating a tuple
2. Accessing elements
3. Tuple immutability
4. Tuple methods
5. Indexing and slicing

---

## 📘 Theory (Operations on Tuple)

### 1. Creating a Tuple

A tuple is created using round brackets ().
Example: `my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)`

### 2. Accessing Elements

Elements are accessed using index numbers.
Example: `my_tuple[3]`

### 3. Tuple Immutability

Tuple elements cannot be changed once created.
Example: `my_tuple[1] = 10` (Error)

### 4. Tuple Operations

* len() – returns number of elements
* count() – counts occurrences of an element
* index() – returns index of an element

### 5. Tuple Concatenation

Tuples can be joined using + operator.
Example: `(1,2) + (3,4)`

### 6. Tuple Repetition

Tuples can be repeated using * operator.
Example: `(1,2) * 2`

## 🛠 Tools Used

* Python Interpreter
* IDLE
* VS Code
* PyCharm
* Command Prompt / Terminal

---

## 📂 Applications of Tuple

* Storing fixed data
* Coordinates (x, y)
* Returning multiple values from functions
* Database records
* Read-only data storage

---

## 🎯 Conclusion

Tuples are an essential data structure in Python when data integrity is important. Since tuples are immutable, they provide better performance and security compared to lists. Understanding tuples is important for efficient and reliable Python programming.

---

## 📎 Extra Notes

* Tuple indexing starts from 0
* Single-element tuple needs a comma: `(5,)`
* Tuples can contain lists
* Immutable but can be nested
